Hymn For The Weekend (Seeb Remix)
Coldplay

Oh, angel sent from up above
You know you make my world light up
When I was down, when I was hurt
You came to lift me up
Life is a drink and love's a drug
Oh now I think I must be miles up
When I was a river dried up
You came to rain a flood

I-Oh-I-Oh
Got me feeling drunk and high
So high, so high
Oh-I-Oh-I-Oh
Now I¡¯m feeling drunk and high
So high, so high
Feeling drunk and high
Feeling drunk and high

Oh, angel sent from up above
I feel it coursing through my blood
Life is a drink and your love's about
To make the stars come out

I-Oh-I-Oh
Got me feeling drunk and high
So high, so high
Oh-I-Oh-I-Oh
Now I¡¯m feeling drunk and high
So high, so high
Feeling drunk and high
Feeling drunk and high
So high, so high

Then we'll shoot across the sky
Then we'll shoot across the...
Then we'll shoot across the sky
Then we'll shoot across the...
Then we'll shoot across the sky
Then we'll shoot across the...
Then we'll shoot across the sky
Then we'll shoot across the...
Then we'll shoot across the sky
Then we'll shoot across the...
